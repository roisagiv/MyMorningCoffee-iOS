HackerRank currently has about 120 employees; split evenly between the company's Palo Alto, Calif., headquarters and India. The company got started in 2011, emerging from the Y Combinator incubator -- but Ravisankar said he thinks of Burnett as \"a late-stage cofounder of the company.\"\r\n\r\nBurnett steps into a company that's made surprising headway already in selling its services. HackerRank's corporate clients currently include Amazon, Chipotle, Wal-Mart and Verizon. These companies gain access to the results of HackerRank's many&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #000000\">&nbsp;</span><a style=\"color: #003891\" href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/contests\">online coding contests</a><span style=\"color: #000000\">, which to date have attracted slightly more than one million software engineers from around the world. Clients pay HackerRank fees in return for identifying top performers and making it easy for corporate recruiters to hire these stars.&nbsp;</span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_6647\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-6647\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/georgeanders/files/2015/09/HackerRank-1940x827.jpg\" alt=\"Grady Burnett (l.) and Vivek Ravisankar (Photo credit: HackerRank)\"> Grady Burnett (l.) and Vivek Ravisankar (Photo credit: HackerRank)[/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">Ravisankar thinks his company's opportunities have just begun. He estimates that there are 30 million software engineers in the world, far exceeding HackerRank's current database. \"If people switch jobs every four years or so,\" he added, \"there are about 7 million job placements a year, up for grabs. Even at our biggest clients, we're only 10% penetrated right now.\"</span>\r\n\r\nBurnett has plenty of experience running big sales operations. He was vice president for global sales and operations at Facebook from 2009 to 2013, and before that was a director of online sales and operations at Google. Most recently, he served as chief operating officer for Flurry, a mobile analytics and advertising site that was acquired by Yahoo last year for $300 million.\r\n\r\nFrom those earlier jobs, Burnett said, \"I've personally seen the holes in the traditional hiring process. In the past, we used blunt credentials, like grade-point average or school, to filter through high volumes of candidates. But those filters consistently leave out diamonds in the rough.\" He contends that HackerRank's on-the-spot assessments of coding skills \"democratize hiring and create opportunities for people from all walks of life.\"\r\n\r\nBurnett helped set up Facebook's India operations -- experience that will come in handy in his new job.

HackerRank currently has about 120 employees; split evenly between the company’s Palo Alto, Calif., headquarters and India. The company got started in 2011, emerging from the Y Combinator incubator — but Ravisankar said he thinks of Burnett as “a late-stage cofounder of the company.”</p>\n<p>Burnett steps into a company that’s made surprising headway already in selling its services.

He estimates that there are 30 million software engineers in the world, far exceeding HackerRank’s current database. “If people switch jobs every four years or so,” he added, “there are about 7 million job placements a year, up for grabs. Even at our biggest clients, we’re only 10% penetrated right now.”</span></p>\n<p>Burnett has plenty of experience running big sales operations. He was vice president for global sales and operations at Facebook from 2009 to 2013, and before that was a director of online sales and operations at Google. Most recently, he served as chief operating officer for Flurry, a mobile analytics and advertising site that was acquired by Yahoo last year for $300 million.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>From those earlier jobs, Burnett said, “I’ve personally seen the holes in the traditional hiring process.
